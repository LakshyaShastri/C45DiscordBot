## Pull requests
Pull requests are to be used when merging your branch into `master`. If your branch is behind use the "Rebase and commit" option
or simply "Merge and commit". We will not use "Squash and commit" as you should squash your commits inot a handful of meaningful ones
if there are any superfluous or excessively large number of commits in your branch.

If you would like a code review then add a contributor as a reviewer.
