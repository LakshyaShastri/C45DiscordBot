What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

Tristan kildaire is actually a prretty cool dude, despite what all the other people say about him, he is genuinely so nice and helpful, he might flex alot and shit like that but deep inside he has a massive throbbing x86 processor. Infact Tristan is so LARGE AND THICC that he has managed to make sure RISC-V will never see theday of light. Infact he has a vector table where every vector just says "Bruh oomblik", he is based and you are not. He has his own RC network too to flex. You better not touch this dual-citiznship boi because I am telling you he owns so many 3d printed firearms that he could only dream of and he will annihlate your CPU.
